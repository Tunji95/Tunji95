## 🧪 Labs & Featured Projects  
Here are some hands-on labs and security simulations I’ve built (see repos for steps, screenshots, and results):  

### 🔍 1) Network Security Monitoring (Wireshark + Snort)  
- Captured and analyzed network traffic, configured Snort IDS, and simulated intrusion attempts.  
- **Results:** Detected **5/5** test intrusions, reduced false positives by tuning Snort rules.  
- **Repo:** [Network-Security-Monitoring](https://github.com/Tunji95/Network-Security-Monitoring)  

### 🛡️ 2) Vulnerability Scanning & Hardening (Nmap + Nessus)  
- Scanned Linux/Windows VMs, prioritized CVEs, and remediated misconfigurations.  
- **Results:** Reduced exposed services **12 → 3**, eliminated all **High/Critical** findings.  
- **Repo:** [Penetration-Testing-Lab](https://github.com/Tunji95/Penetration-Testing-Lab)  

### 🖥️ 3) Active Directory Hardening (GPO + PowerShell)  
- Built a test AD domain and implemented **least privilege, auditing, and Group Policies**.  
- **Results:** Improved CIS-style compliance by **25%**, successfully tested LAPS & PowerShell logging.  
- **Repo:** [Active-Directory-Hardening](https://github.com/Tunji95/Active-Directory-Hardening)  

### ☁️ 4) Azure Cloud Security Simulation (IAM + NSGs + Logging)  
- Deployed a small Azure environment with IAM roles, NSGs, and security monitoring.  
- **Results:** Improved Azure Secure Score, blocked test attacks with least-privilege rules.  
- **Repo:** [Azure-Cloud-Security](https://github.com/Tunji95/Azure-Cloud-Security)
